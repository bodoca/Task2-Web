# Task2-Web
Web application testing through automation with Selenium Java and TestNG with a ChromeDriver

There are many web drivers out there which one can use for multi-browser testing, however for the sake of submitting only ChromeDriver.exe was used. Make sure to change the DRIVER-PATH on the line containing System.setProperty(driver, DRIVER-PATH).

Note: All external JAR files have been uploaded in the third part libraries directory. Should you have a problem with references, please note that all references use a full-path which points to C:.

To execute, right click on testng.xml -> hover over Run As -> choose TestNG option.
